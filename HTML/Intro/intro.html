Mexico is seeding clouds to make rain — scientists aren’t sure it works
Researchers question the government’s investment, given uncertainties about the technology.

Farmers in Mexico desperate for rain are asking their government to ‘bomb’ the clouds. The country is experiencing its second-worst drought in a decade, and farmers are afraid for their crops and livestock. So they’ve asked the Mexican government to use cloud-seeding technology to help them.

In March, the National Commission for Arid Zones (Conaza), a branch of the country’s agriculture ministry, announced that it would launch a rain-stimulation programme in the northeastern and northwestern states of Tamaulipas and Baja California, respectively. <br>

        Over the past decade, China’s once-pollution-choked skies have steadily improved, according to more than two decades of atmospheric measurements taken by NASA satellites. But researchers say that there is still a long way to go to clean China’s air and protect the health of its citizens.

The speed at which China has reduced its air pollution has been “impressive”, says Chi Li, an atmospheric scientist at Washington University of St. Louis in Missouri, owing to technological solutions and ambitious policies. <br>

Air pollution in China is falling — but there is a long way to go
Easy gains from upgrading power-plant smokestacks will be strengthened only by deeper policy changes.

Over the past decade, China’s once-pollution-choked skies have steadily improved, according to more than two decades of atmospheric measurements taken by NASA satellites. But researchers say that there is still a long way to go to clean China’s air and protect the health of its citizens.

The speed at which China has reduced its air pollution has been “impressive”, says Chi Li, an atmospheric scientist at Washington University of St. Louis in Missouri, owing to technological solutions and ambitious policies.

Each year, air pollution is responsible for more than four million premature deaths globally — including an estimated one million in China — primarily from heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory illnesses. Fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less — referred to as PM2.5 — is the most concerning air pollutant, says Li.

The university’s Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group, which Li is part of, monitors various pollutants and estimates their global health impacts. The data for China show that from the late 1990s, average annual PM2.5 exposure in the country rose from 35 to more than 50 micrograms per cubic metre, before levelling out around 2006 at between 50 and 601. Since 2013, PM2.5 levels have steadily declined, and in 2021, the average annual exposure was 33.3 micrograms per cubic metre (see ‘Fresh air’). That’s below the nation’s air-quality standard of 35, but still much higher that the recommended level of 5 set by the World Health Organization (WHO), based in Geneva, Switzerland.

        An institute that aims to improve how equality and diversity policies are applied to brain research has launched at University College London. The founders say that although equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) guidelines are now common in research, they do not necessarily lead to scientists applying the values to their studies and work environments in practice.

Many universities, scientific journals and funding agencies have EDI principles, says Aikaterini Fotopoulou, a University College London (UCL) neuropsychologist and leader of the Centre for Equality Research in Brain Sciences (ERB Centre), which launched on 19 April. “But that’s not the same as knowing how to do equality. Intention is not action.”

Researchers and clinicians at the ERB Centre will study how to best practice EDI in the brain and mind sciences — from increasing the diversity of study participants to ensuring that the field includes scientists from a range of backgrounds and supports them with evidence-based EDI policies throughout their careers.

“EDI are often thought to be issues that can be discussed administratively without oftentimes using research backing, so having a research centre dedicated to these issues will be a big leap for the field,” says Mahmoud Maina, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK.
