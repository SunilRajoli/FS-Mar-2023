<!--
Cookie domain attribute:
            A JavaScript domain attribute specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.
Let's suppose if we provide any domain name to the attribute such like:
            domain = "Javapoint.com"
            Here, the cookie is valid for the given domain and all its sub-domains.
However, if we provide any sub-domain to the attribute such like:
            omain=training.javatpoint.com
            Here, the cookie is valid only for the given sub-domain.
            So, it's a better approach to provide domain name instead of sub-domain.
